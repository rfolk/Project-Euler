Project Euler

These are my solutions to the problems available from http://projecteuler.net

I recommend that everyone who is attempting the problems work out their own
solutions before comparing notes with me. The heart and soul of the program is
working out your own solutions and figuring out implementation. I am merely
publishing this as a compare notes, look at optimization type of thing.

Every solution will be written in Python 3 which I am attempting to learn.
